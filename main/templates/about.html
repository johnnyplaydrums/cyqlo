                    and enjoyable for novice bikers. Cyqlo provides bikers with curated routes
                    that bring them to interesting destinations and help reconnect them with
                    their environment. </p>

                <p align="left" class="font-size-16px" > As a team who enjoys biking around NYC, we discovered that there are not
                    many applications that enhance the biking experience and make it more
                    fulfilling. We understand how inaccessible biking around NYC can feel and
                    how tough it is to find interesting routes out of the city.

                <p align="left" class="font-size-16px"> With this in mind, weâ€™ve decided to help novice bikers explore untapped
                    areas and provide them with an enriching biking experience that will also
                    reconnect them with their surroundings. Cyqlo will take the guess work out of planning weekend excursions and help
                    users pick a route that is just right for them. </p>
